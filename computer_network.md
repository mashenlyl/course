## 1.Introdution

Welcome to networking. I'm Nick and I'll be your teacher in this course. And I'm Josh. Nick and I have prepared a set of fun projects for you to tackle. We have an awesome coursed prepared for you. We'll be covering advanced concepts in networking. Such as software defined networking, data center networking and content distribution. You'll complete projects using a state of the art network emulator called mini-net to understand and explore these advanced concepts. Leading up to a final project replicating actual networking research.

Welcome to the graduate course on computer networking. The primary goal of this course is to provide a survey of the necessary tools, techniques, and concepts to perform research in computer communications. This is a project based course, and there will be significant emphasis on hands-on experience. In networking, perhaps more than many other subjects, realization is key. You can read about concepts or techniques in a textbook, but really the most effective way to learn networking is by doing. So, you'll gain a lot of hands on experience in this course. Through the assignments. In comparison to an introductory networking course, which you may have taken, this course will provide more in depth coverage of networking topics. And, it willalso offer a crash course in some of the available tools that are now available for performing research in computer networking. You will gain experience, with many of these tools, through the project based assignments in the course.
